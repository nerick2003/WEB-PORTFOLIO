                    I am a dedicated 2nd-year Information Technology student at the University of 
                    Science and Technology of Southern Philippines, with a strong passion for 
                    technology and software development. My journey in IT has been exciting and 
                    challenging, pushing me to continuously learn and adapt to new technologies.

                    My interests span across <strong>software development</strong>, 
                    <strong>web development</strong>, <strong>database management</strong>, and 
                    <strong>software engineering</strong>. I enjoy building projects that solve 
                    real-world problems and contribute to making technology more accessible and 
                    user-friendly.
